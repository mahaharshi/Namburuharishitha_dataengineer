Functions:  write_into_csv(fields: List[str]) -> None
            upload_to_amazon_s3_bucket(file_path: str, bucket_name: str, object_name: str) -> bool
            main()
The write_into_csv function takes a list of strings fields as input and writes it to a CSV file named "output.csv". It returns None.

The upload_to_amazon_s3_bucket function takes three string inputs file_path, bucket_name, and object_name, and uploads the file specified by file_path to an Amazon S3 bucket with name bucket_name and object name object_name. It returns True if the upload is successful, and False otherwise.

The main function is the main entry point of the program. It reads an XML file, extracts specific elements from it, and writes them to a CSV file using the write_into_csv function. Then it uploads the CSV file to an Amazon S3 bucket using the upload_to_amazon_s3_bucket function. If either of these operations fails, an error message is logged using the logger object.
